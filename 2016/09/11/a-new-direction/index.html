<h2 id="My-Journey-Into-Software-Engineering"><a href="#My-Journey-Into-Software-Engineering" class="headerlink" title="My Journey Into Software Engineering"></a>My Journey Into Software Engineering</h2><p>Back in May of this year I decided it was time for a change. After working in food service and retail for a decade, I had a clear picture of what I do not want in a career. I do not want to do the same thing every day, or ever feel like I’ve learned all there is to know about my job. I do want a career that’s challenging, where I get to create and learn constantly. This led me to software engineering, and eventually to apply to Hack Reactor, a coding bootcamp.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Choosing-Hack-Reactor"><a href="#Choosing-Hack-Reactor" class="headerlink" title="Choosing Hack Reactor"></a>Choosing Hack Reactor</h2><p>Since realising it’s time for a change, I’ve been on a mission to learn as much as I can about building useful, intelligently designed software and web applications. As soon as I learned about the programming bootcamp options out there, I knew that was the path for me. I took some time researching and comparing bootcamps. There are so many options out there now that it is almost overwhelming. At the end of the day, most of these camps made similar claims about student outcomes, but Hack Reactor stood out to me for it’s commitment to teaching the fundamentals of programming, not just giving you a few flashy tricks that might impress a potential empoloyeer. Ultimately, my goal is to become a great software engineer, not just to find a job.</p>
<p>If I wasn’t already sold on Hack Reactor, a Q&amp;A session I attended online with one of the staff at HR sealed the deal. He had a background in teaching, and spoke about how much he likes HR’s education philosophy. In high school and college, I finished more than a few classes feeling like I had checked all the boxes and done all that was asked of me, but learned little or nothing. I was (and am) drawn to HR’s focus on student autonomy, and learning by doing.</p>
<h2 id="Hello-World"><a href="#Hello-World" class="headerlink" title="Hello World"></a>Hello World</h2><p>In preparing to apply for Hack Reactor, I first had to learn the basics of JavaScript. I already had a passing familiarity with coding, having built a website using PHP and MySQL a few years before, but that knowledge was rusty, to say the least, and certainly incomplete. There are seemingly endless resources on the web now to get started with learning a programming language. My go-to’s for learning JavaScript (in order) were: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/learn/javascript?gclid=CjwKEAjwu8m-BRDM8KTcjdj8qy0SJACdjSZpos6C6Y78YJKaLV2vLXYQwz8DvnZeXrPnLTJz6W61bxoCDsnw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="external">Code School JavaScript Road Trip</a> - Videos are thorough and easy to follow</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript" target="_blank" rel="external">Codecaemy JavaScript tutorial</a> - Hands on, good for getting comfortable with syntax</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">Eloquent JavaScript</a> - I read chapters 1-5 of this at least 3 times, and learned something new every time. If I could simply download this book into my brain, I’m sure I’d be able to do ANYTHING with JavaScript.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.codewars.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Code Wars</a> - If you don’t have fun on Code Wars, programming is not for you. It makes you think for yourself, and gets you comfortable with the language.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://coderbyte.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Coderbyte</a> - Similar to Code Wars, I worked through most of the Easy Difficulty problems, and a few of the Medium Difficulty</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans" target="_blank" rel="external">Javascript Koans</a> - Introduced me to GitHub and test runners as well as teaching me JavaScript</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also tried to talk to other people about coding. I discovered a lot of gaps in my knowledge by trying to explain what I was learning or doing to another person with some programming knowledge. Getting out of my comfortable bubble of coding tutorials and explaining concepts in my own words would often launch me to a new level of understanding.</p>
<h2 id="My-First-Test"><a href="#My-First-Test" class="headerlink" title="My First Test"></a>My First Test</h2><p>After studying intesively (meaning in every bit of freetime I had outside of work) for 6 weeks, I felt ready to attempt the Hack Reactor admissions interview. Once I was able to tackle Easy problems on Coderbyte, and levels 7 &amp; 8 kyu problems on Code Wars without having to look up syntax or suggestions on Google, and felt I could understand and explain all the examples in Eloquent JavaScript, especially in Chapters 4 &amp; 5, I signed up for my interview slot.</p>
<p>The interview itself was much less intimidating than I expected. My interviewer was personable, friendly, and helpful. I’d read a lot of advice from previous students about the interview, and the common theme among them was to explain your thought process. I made a point to take a minute to think about each problem, then put into words how I would do it, write out some pseudo-code, and only after all of that, actually write the code. To my immense surprise, I passed on the first round.</p>
<p>Reflecting back on the last 4 months, my main advice to someone headed down a similar path is learn to answer your own questions. The greatest skill I’ve acquired so far is knowing where to look for answers. I’ve also realized that when I find an answers for myself, instead of having it given to me, I am way more likely to remember it, and be able to apply it in the future. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">StackOverflow</a> and taking the time to read program documentation have been instrumental to my learning process.</p>
<h2 id="Looking-Forward"><a href="#Looking-Forward" class="headerlink" title="Looking Forward"></a>Looking Forward</h2><p>Since going through the bootcamp application process and learning some JavaScript basics, I’ve been focused on building something. I was splashing around in the kiddie pool while learning the language, and now I’m diving into the ocean of frameworks, asynchronicity, servers, and databases. I’ll discuss the transition from learning a language to building a web app in another post, but for now I’m anxiously anticipating starting Hack Reactor, and turning my newfound passion into a full blown skill. </p>
